How on chain credentials will solve trust problems and will make global talent pool more accessible?

On chain credentials, in the form of tokens, will solve marketing problems for thousands of developer  (especially in freelancing industry).
Currently people need to have social media following or write blogs or develop a audience in some way to get into attention of employers and get a good jon opportunity. Everyone doesn't like marketing, and many people doesn't get access to the opportunities.
On the other hand employeers also struggle to find the right candidate. 
On-chain composible credentials solves both the problems. 
It also bring the global talent pool accessible to everyone.
They will provide a way to instantly show the proof of skills and develop trust between two parties.



<=====================================================================================================>
Tokens can provide a way to build open networks (which can defeat the centralised systems), like wired back in 2007, which would be available to everyone. It will be like a centralised database which can store the info of all the users and anyone can access it. 
There will not be a single network, it will be a combination of many networks and the playing field will be equal for everyone. (Same like the early internet.).
There will not be a few networks controlling a huge part, it will be a open network build from thousands of networks.
